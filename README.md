For the development and implementation of computer vision algorithms for the automatic mosquito dissection robot for Sanaria Inc. using classical and deep learning based methods.

Malaria accounted for 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths worldwide as of 2019. It is an understatement to say that there is a need for vaccine development and deployment. Sanaria Inc. has found groundbreaking results and progress in a malaria vaccine, which uses mosquito salivary glands for research and synthesis. However, these glands are difficult to extract manually and often requires high skill and precision, not to mention it also being time consuming. As a result, JHU is developing an automated system that can mass-extract salivary glands from mosquitos. There has been a collaboration between JHU CIIS and Sanaria Inc. in order to produce a robotic system to complete this task.
